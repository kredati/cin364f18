## Course Overview
### Description
This course aims to give students the theoretical tools to understand how media technologies organize our experience and structure our subjectivity. To that end, it focuses on theories of media that attend to the correlations of technics and experience. That said, this correlation is a deeply historical phenomenon that changes according to the affordances of technology as well as the larger political, economic, social, and cultural horizons in which technologies and persons take their shape. Because of this, the course is organized in a broad sense historically, into three units: “Classical” Media Theory, Technics & Experience, and Computational Media. The first focus on theories of media that predate the computer; the second are theories of media that largely belong to a “transitional” period when digital computation was speculative as much as anything; and the third offers a theoretical and historical treatment of computation as our present milieu. The course is largely focused on working through a canon of media theory, and aims to give students a rigorous introduction to the field, with particular attention to the intersections between film theory and media theory.

### Course goals
I hate the contractual language of outcomes; I cannot predict what you will learn. Any predication of learning in terms of inputs and outputs is, to use a euphemism, cynically optimistic. It promises an ease and a clarity which is almost never on offer in humanistic, especially theoretical, knowledges.

My goals for you this term are as follows:
* **To get excited by at least one thing.** I hope for you to get _really_ excited about at least one of the things we discuss together.
* **To get more comfortable with the uncomfortable parts of humanistic learning.** Often, it can feel like the point of coursework is to get things right; I am hoping instead for you to ask better questions. Asking good questions means _not understanding things_. Much of the material we are grappling with this semester is abstruse (i.e. it is written in ways that are obscure) as well as difficult (the issues at hand have no easy answers). You’ll be confused. This may well feel bad (anxious, frustrating, depressing, desperate). I am hoping that you can learn to live with those feelings.
* **To move forward when the path isn’t clear.** I will be asking you to think and speak and write from places of confusion (and anxiety, frustration, depression, etc.). I know I am doing this. I am asking you to do so _not_ because I’m perverse and want to catch you out in vulnerable times. I am asking you to do so because these places of confusion (& anxiety &c.) are the _norm_ for good research, and for much of adult life. Figuring out how to keep working despite confusion is a scholarly and a life skill.
* **To engage in theoretical speculation about your world.** Your world, and mine, are organized by highly technologized capitalism, and this course is meant to give you some (not all!) tools to ask profound questions about what it means to live in this world, and how we might arrange for better prospects in that world. No easy answers! But I’ll also treat you like grownups: I’m going to ask you what you make of these difficult things, what you don’t understand about them, what you’d like to understand better, &c. I will ask you, that is, to engage in acts of theoretical speculation.
* **To expand your sense of the remit of cinema studies.** You may have come to understand the intellectual project of cinema studies as largely being about watching, and analyzing, and then perhaps engaging in acts of criticism about, things we call movies: mostly narrative, mostly feature-length, mostly taking place in cinemas before showing up on TVs and iPhones. I am here to tell you--as our resident professor of “cinema and digital media”--that it is much larger than that. We will spend some time with movies. But we can think about the intellectual project of cinema studies differently: film theory is a body of thinking about what it means to engage in a world unfolding before you that exists only by means of technological operations. But that could also mean Facebook. We will work with that knowledge, and the intellectual dispositions of cinema studies, to talk about technological media including the cinema, but also mostly beyond cinema, to wit: industrial technology writ large, gramophony, television, science fiction, and especially, digital computation.

### How we will spend our time together
Generally speaking, we will have some kind of primary source material to encounter and discuss on Mondays; on Tuesdays we will work through the primary material and the theory. Note that the primary emphasis in this course is on _theory_ rather than history, aesthetics, or criticism.

#### Reading
This theoretical emphasis means that the reading for this course is relatively more important than in other CIN classes. The pedagogy in this class is oriented as much as possible toward encouraging careful reading. I have done my best to limit the amount of reading we do, to attempt to do it as slowly as possible. I will be sure to give you priorities when the reading seems to be heavier than usual.

#### Screening
Many, but not all weeks, we will watch a film. Many of these are shorter than feature length, and only one of them is narrative (and I suspect that most of you will not like it: Michael Mann’s 2015 exorbitant failure, _Blackhat_, which is interesting for how and why it is a failure).

#### Classtime
When we are not having a longer screening, classtime will _always_ begin in the following way:
* aannouncements
* questions
* think/pair/share
* discussion

**Announcements,** I take it, don’t need any explanation.

**Questions.** For about 5 to 10 minutes, students ask questions. I will take notes, perhaps asking clarifying questions. These questions will set the agenda for our time together. Note that I, while preparing the material, do _not_ prepare a lesson plan for a given session. I don’t know what you don’t understand; I also don’t know what you’re interested in. This isn’t to say that I don’t have some expectations, and attachments, or even hopes. But it really is up to you to develop our agenda. _Note: This means that if we are not talking about what you want to be talking about, you should ask more questions. It is up to you to put your interests on the table._

**Think/pair/share.** After questions, you’ll spend 5 minutes thinking & writing into one of your favorite questions, and then the following 5 minutes talking about what you wrote with a partner. After that, I will then say something along the lines of, “I wonder what you talked about.” That’s your cue to start reporting discussion. After collecting some responses, we’ll be off to the races with the remaining classtime for further discussion, and some of my holding-forth when I think things need explaining.

#### A note on attendance.
If you are going to miss class, you do not need to notify me. I will likely not respond to your email, and in any event, I do not wish to micromanage your life. I do not take attendance. Also, the sorts of things you must be in attendance for (questions, checkins--see below) cannot be made up in any event (although see the section on Accommodations, below).

## Coursework
There are a few moving parts to the coursework. It is on you to be on top of all the things. Here’s the breakdown:

* Ongoing, low-stakes coursework:
  - Questions (10%)
  - Checkins (10%)
* Writing assignments:
  - Mini-papers (10%)
  - Midterm papers (2 @ 15%)
* And, a final project (40%)

### Ongoing, low-stakes
#### Questions (10%)
At the beginning of each class, we will have a period of 5 to 10 minutes for student questions. **This sets the agenda for the course.** You are responsible for asking _at least 5 questions_ over the course of the term. At the end of term, I simply count up the number of questions you ask, up to five, and then divide that number by 5. That’s effectively your participation mark for the term.

Note that you _must_ be in class to ask questions; no form of make-up is available. Note that we will have ~12 classes in which to ask questions. Also note: you must keep track of this. The notes I take during questions periods will be available on Canvas.

#### Checkins (10%)
Every week, you’ll receive a questionnaire. This will appear as a “quiz” in Canvas. It will go live starting immediately after class on Tuesday, and will be available through midnight on Wednesday. It will have three questions:

1. What did you find most interesting in class this week?
2. What did you struggle with the most?
3. What do you wish we had talked more about in class?

The answers to this will not be anonymous; for a number of reasons, I’d like names attached to these answers (if only so I can identify students in trouble early, but for a great many other reasons as well). There are 10 weeks of content in the course. Your checkin mark is the percentage of checkins you complete, up to 8, out of 8.

Note that you should only fill out the checkins if you have actually attended class in the week in question. (How else are you going to find class discussions interesting or lacking?)

### Writing (40%)
#### Mini-papers (10% in aggregate)
You will probably hate mini-papers. I’m sorry.

Every week, starting at noon on Friday, a “quiz” will open on Canvas with a single essay question. You have 15 minutes to complete the “essay.” You must complete the mini-paper by noon on Monday. **{FIXME: Deadline for mini-paper.}** The essay question will ask you to explicate or analyze or synthesize something from the reading.

You are free to use any notes you make, and to have the reading in front of you. You are not free to collaborate, to discuss the questions with one another, or to Google (or DuckDuckGo or Bing or AskJeeves or otherwise search on the Internet) for help).

The pedagogical purpose of these is threefold: (1) to keep you honest about the reading, (2) to get you to practice writing about this stuff in a low-stakes way, and (3) to give me information about how you’re doing with the reading.

There will be 9 mini-papers. Your mark will be the average of your best 7. **{TODO: Figure out Canvas rubrics and how to do heuristic marking; explain that here.}**

#### Midterm Papers (15% each, 2 over the course of the term)
Over the course of the term, there will be two midterm papers, each between 1,200 and 1,500 words (approx 4–5 pages). They are:
* Analytical summary. Due October 5.
* Conceptual adjudication. Due November 12.

The parameters for these will be distributed at two weeks in advance. They will be straightforward academic papers with fairly substantial guidance on how to proceed. In each case, they will ask you to work closely with theoretical texts.

### Final Project (40%)
Your final project will be approximately 4,000 words of writing. This writing can be fairly traditional academic work, or it can be more experimental. Unlike in many of my other courses, I _am_ insisting on writing this time. I am open to collaborative projects within reason. What this project will be about, and how it is about what it is about, is largely up to you, again within reason. You are encouraged to meet with me early and often to discuss final project ideas. There will be a great deal of _process-based_ work here, which will be explained in great detail and subject to quasi-democratic procedures starting after reading week. The final project will include several components, including the project itself, a pecha kucha presentation, a rubric, and a process letter (describing and evaluating your goals and process).

### Accommodations
There are a lot of moving parts in this class, and many (but not all) of them are amenable to (sometimes quite significant) accommodations. These accommodations are bespoke, in any event. If you are going to request accommodations of any kind, you must (_must_) visit me, in my actual office, withn two weeks of joining the class, accommodations letter at the ready, to discuss those accommodations you seek. We will negotiate a mutually agreeable set of accommodations for you.

### Deadlines
I understand that life happens. You should understand that _when_ life happens, as an adult you are responsible for communicating well about it. If you are going to flub a deadline, let me know _as soon as you can_. I am much, much more generous and forgiving on deadlines if I have plenty of lead time to negotiate.

If you are requesting an extension following an accommodations scheme, you _must_ work that out with me at least a week in advance of the deadline.

#### Late work
That said, if the work *is* late, it is an automatic plus/minus (~3.3%) late penalty per stepwise 24-hour period the work is late. If the deadline is 5pm on Friday, and I receive it at 6pm on Friday, or 4:55pm on Saturday, that’s 1 late day; 5:05pm on Saturday is 2 late days, etc. The penalty is automatic and impersonal; I won’t have feelings about it, although I understand that you might.
